MVC .NET Survey Application

# Description
Webapplication in which you can create and take surveys.  
As of now it's only a demo application since there is no authentication which prohibits users from editing/deleting surveys

# Features

- create/edit/delete surveys
- create/edit/delete questions
- change question order
- different question types
  - open
  * multiple choice
  * rating
- take/submit surveys
- created surveys and survey results are stored in SQLite database

# Todo
- authentication
- some presentation of survey results
  - bar graphs

Right now the only way to query results is with a 3rd party tool like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
